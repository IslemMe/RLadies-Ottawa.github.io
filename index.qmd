## About R-Ladies

[R-Ladies](https://www.rladies.org) is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. The R community suffers from an under-representation of minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educators, or users.
