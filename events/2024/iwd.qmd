## Challenge

The objective of this data challenge is to analyze *investing in women*. This is a very open-ended challenge, so be as creative as you'd like!

Some examples include:

* Analyze venture capital investment data to understand trends in funding for women-led startups.
* Analyze businesses or organizations that promote women's empowerment.
* Analyze data on gender diversity in leadership positions.

You can use any data source, but the following are examples:

* [Measuring the value of women's contribution to the Canadian economy: New insights based on recent work](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/36-28-0001/2023002/article/00001-eng.htm)
* [Statistics Canada's *Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics Hub*](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/topics-start/gender_diversity_and_inclusion)
* [Statistics Canada's *Average percentage of women and men in management positions* tables](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3310066001)

## Guidelines

Although this challenge is hosted by *R-Ladies* Ottawa, you don't have to use R to participate. You could use R, Python, a combination of the two, or anything you're comfortable with! 

No previous programming experience is required! If you're interested in participating, but aren't sure where to start, check out the recordings from our [Introduction to R workshops](https://rladies-ottawa.gitub.io/events/2024/intro_to_r.html) that we hosted in early 2024. The workshops will give you a solid foundation in data analysis and data visualization using R.

While anyone is welcome to participate in the challenge and submit an entry, **only submissions by women and gender minorities who reside in Canada will be eligible for the prizes.**

You can participate individually, or in teams of up to 5 people!

## Prizes

Prize details will be released at a later date.

## How to submit an entry

This will be a month-long data challenge, and you'll have until **April 7th** to submit your entry. Your submission can be in any form you like -- it can be a Quarto document, an image, a link to a webpage, or a link to a video, for example.

There are two options for submitting an entry: 

* Option 1 (preferred option): If you have experience with GitHub and Quarto, you can create a pull request on [this repository](https://github.com/RLadies-Ottawa/rladies-ottawa.github.io) and add your submission to the ["Submissions"](iwd.qmd#submissions) part of this page
* Option 2: If you don't have experience with GitHub, you can email ottawa@rladies.org a link to your submission materials and we will add the link to the ["Submissions"](iwd.qmd#submissions) part of this page

## Showcasing your analysis

After the submission deadline, R-Ladies Ottawa will host an event where participants can showcase their work. This is a great way to learn from one another and to connect with other like-minded individuals!

The date and time of the showcase event will be determined by sending out a poll after the submission deadline, to those who wish to participate.

## Submissions

Please use this section of the page to submit your entries. You can create a subheading with your name and include any materials you'd like to share with others!
