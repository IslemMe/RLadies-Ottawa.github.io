## Challenge

Details will be posted soon.

## Guidelines

Although this challenge is hosted by *R-Ladies* Ottawa, you don't have to use R to participate. You could use R, Python, a combination of the two, or anything you're comfortable with! 

No previous programming experience is required! If you're interested in participating, but aren't sure where to start, check out the recordings from our [Introduction to R workshops](https://www.rladies-ottawa.gitub.io/events/2024/intro_to_r.html) that we hosted in early 2024. The workshops will give you a solid foundation in data analysis and data visualization using R.

While anyone is welcome to participate in the challenge and submit an entry, **only submissions by women and gender minorities who reside in Canada will be eligible for the prizes.**

You can participate individually, or in teams of up to 5 people!

## Need help finding a team member?

If you're interested in participating in the challenge as part of a team, but need help finding team members, come to our [International Women's Day Networking Event and Data Challenge Kickoff]() on March 8th!
